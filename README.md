# John Bot
John Bot is a discord bot coded in python for my friend, John Smillie, who does animations on YouTube. John Bot runs his discord server and is a helpful bot for moderators and a fun bot for his server members. This bot is my most recent python project and it has seen a lot of development from when I first created it.
